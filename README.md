# pyqt5
A very basic standalone application with a simple GUI made using Pyqt5.

Consists of a grid view, with 5 different buttons and a very basic inbuilt browser.

Buttons are used to open the link in the browser and then capturing the screenshot of the whole window and latter sending the mail with a subject, body and the attachments by invoking the Outlook application on Windows OS.
